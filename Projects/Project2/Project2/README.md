# Project 2

This is a prototype for my project 2 idea. It will show how my project will work but on a smaller scale.
My idea is a cliche and funny visual novel type of dating simulator about a weird species of long leg fish. You will ask be asked a series of questions and complete short mini games and depending on the answers chosen and outcome of the games you will be paired up with 1 of the 2 dating partner options. One of them is a very edgy and introvert fish while the second one is more of a preppy and outgoing fish. There are also 4 different routes to the final project. There is a happy and sad ending for each fish.
