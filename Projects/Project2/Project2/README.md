# Project 2

My project 2 is a long leg fish love simulator. It is a cliche and funny visual novel type of dating simulator about a weird species of long leg fish. The main character starts their first day of school and is asked to join a club. She must pick one of the two fishes. There are 2 main routes and depending which one you choose, you might end up with 1/2 possible love interests. One of them is a very edgy and introvert fish called Edward while the second one is more of a preppy and outgoing fish called Jake. There are four different endings. You can end up with either of the 2 fish or with none at all. There are also 2 different minigames for each route.

For my artistic vision I wanted to make a short love story with some simple minigames. I wanted to include everything I learned so far. Although the code is fairly simple, I tried to make up for it with many states and interactivity, as well as the original art for the characters. Since the setting is in a school I included some blurred stock images of school backgrounds from google images. I also included a typewriter effect in some of the states to mimic other visual novel games. I wanted the user to get to be able to choose their outcomes and not just have a very linear story so I included many different outcomes.
