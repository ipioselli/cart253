Alt-E8: Reflection
===============

I came into this course with very minimal knowledge on programming. I had taken a few courses on programming before this course but struggled a bit with the material. However, I learned a lot in this course and thought that the material was very thorough and detailed. I really liked how organized it was and that I could always go back and reread or rewatch the material for each week. I also appreciated the idea of having an exercise each week covering the material from that week since It really pushed me to apply what I learned and understand it more in dept.
