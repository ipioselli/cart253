E8: Reflection
===============



I came into this course with very minimal knowledge on programming. I had taken a few courses on programming before this course but struggled a bit with the material. However, I learned a lot in this course and thought that the material was very thorough and detailed. I really liked how organized it was and that I could always go back and reread or rewatch the material for each week. I also appreciated the idea of having an exercise each week covering the material from that week since It really pushed me to apply what I learned and understand it more in dept. \nMy favourite aspects of programming was learning about states and object oriented programming. I found it very cool how you could just switch from different pages using states. I used a lot of states in my Project 2 since it is one of my favourite concepts. I previously took a course on Java and had a lot of diffculty understanding object oriented programming however, the material in this course made it a lot easier to understand and I had a lot more fun using this concept in my Project 2 assignment.
