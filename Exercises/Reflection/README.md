E8: Reflection
===============


- I came into this course with very minimal knowledge on programming. I had taken a few courses on programming before this course but struggled a bit with the material. However, I learned a lot in this course since material was very thorough and detailed. I really liked how organized it was and that I could always go back and reread or rewatch the material for each week. I also appreciated the idea of having an exercise each week covering the material from that week since it really pushed me to apply what I learned and understand it more in dept.

- My favourite aspects of programming was learning about states and object oriented programming. I found it very cool how you could just switch from different pages using states. I used a lot of states in my Project 2 since it is one of my favourite concepts. I previously took a course on Java and had a lot of diffculty understanding object oriented programming however, the material in this course made it a lot easier to understand and I had a lot more fun using this concept in my Project 2 assignment. My favourite exercise to work on was the second one since it was the first time I worked with states and moving objects with keyboard input. I was really amazed by how much you could do with simple code.

- The most challenging elements were implementing arrays. I found it was the most difficult concept for me to grasp and had the most difficulty with the juggle-garden exercise since we had to use both OOP and arrays. I only got to make a simple code for this exercise however, with practice I hope to make more complicated and sophisticated programs using arrays. 

- The project I am most proud of is Project 2 since I got to implement all the concepts i've learned in this course and be as creative as I want. It really shows how far i've come since I knew close to nothing about Javascript and P5 before starting this class. I also always wanted to make a visual novel type of game but never knew how and now I got the chance to do so. 

- In the future I would like to do more experimental/weird exercises to practice my programming skills and I would like to learn more about the 3D elements of P5. I would also like to make more minigames to practice arrays and OOP.
