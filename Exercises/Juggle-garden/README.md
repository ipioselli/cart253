# Exercise 5

Ines Pioselli
- This exercise focuses on using elements of object oriented programming
- I divided the 4 branches and acorn into different classes and call them in the main js file
- In this exercise the user is a branch that is consrained only left and right motion
and must bounce all the acorns off the branch before the timer runs out
- If you manage to bounce more 1 or more acorns before the timer runs out then you win the game
- If they all fall off then you lose and the squirrel wins
